# Why AI Needs Human-Centered Design

As the world continues to become increasingly digital, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving and expanding in its capabilities. One of the most exciting developments in AI is the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model, which has already demonstrated the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries. However, with such power comes responsibility, and it is crucial that we prioritize human-centered design to ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly.

At Optum Health, we are actively working on developing GPT models to improve patient care and outcomes. For example, we are exploring the use of GPT models to create conversational agents that can provide patients with personalized, real-time health information and support. This has the potential to improve access to care and empower patients to take a more active role in managing their health.

However, we are also acutely aware of the ethical concerns surrounding AI, particularly the potential for bad actors to misuse these powerful tools. Geoffrey Hinton, one of the world's leading AI researchers, has warned that GPT models could be used to create highly convincing fake news and propaganda, with devastating consequences for democracy and society as a whole.

To address these concerns, we must prioritize human-centered design in the development of AI. This means putting the needs and values of humans at the forefront of the design process, rather than simply focusing on technical capabilities. By doing so, we can ensure that AI is developed in a way that is ethical, transparent, and accountable.

One way to achieve this is through interdisciplinary collaboration between AI experts, ethicists, social scientists, and other stakeholders. This approach can help ensure that AI is developed in a way that reflects the diverse perspectives and needs of society, rather than simply the interests of a few powerful actors.

In addition, we need to prioritize transparency in the development and deployment of AI. This means being clear about the data and algorithms used to train AI models, as well as the potential biases and limitations of these models. By doing so, we can help build trust in AI and ensure that it is used in a way that is fair and equitable for all.

In conclusion, the development of AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, but it also poses significant ethical challenges. As GPT models continue to be developed and deployed, it is crucial that we prioritize human-centered design
